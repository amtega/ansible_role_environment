## Requirements

- Ansible >= 2.4

## Variables

A list of all the default variables for this role is available in `defaults/main.yml`.

## Dependencies

None.

## Example Playbook

This is an example playbook:

```yaml

  roles:
    - amtega.environment:
  vars:

```

## Testing

Test are based on docker containers. You can run the tests with the following commands:

```shell
$ cd amtega.environment/tests
$ ansible-playbook --skip-tags "role::docker_engine" main.yml
```
